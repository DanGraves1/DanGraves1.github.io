I am a mathematician with research interests in algebraic topology, homological algebra and category theory. I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Sarah Whitehouse](http://www.sarah-whitehouse.staff.shef.ac.uk/). I am currently a teaching fellow at the University of Leeds.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DanGraves1/DanGraves1.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DanGraves1/DanGraves1.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
