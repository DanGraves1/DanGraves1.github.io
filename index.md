I am a mathematician with research interests in algebraic topology, homological algebra and category theory. I am currently a teaching fellow at the University of Leeds.

## Teaching

### University of Sheffield
Here is a list of my teaching at the University of Sheffield, in no particular order. The classes in list come in a range of flavours: lectures, problems classes, flipped learning classes, outreach classes and online assessment.

- Lecturer for MAS003: Foundation mathematics. As part of my role as lecturer I developed a new set of lecture notes for part of the course as well as being responsible for the online tests using [STACK](https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_stack). I have also acted as tutorial demonstrator for this module.
- Lecturer for MAS248. This is a mathematics module for second year undergraduates in chemical engineering. As part of my role I set the exam and mark scheme for this course, with guidance from [Dr. Julia Rees](http://www.jrees.staff.shef.ac.uk/).
- MAS221: Analysis. I have been a tutorial demonstrator, marker and exam marker for this module. I have also delivered some lectures as cover. I have written and coded online tests for this module in both AiM (Assessment in Mathematics) and STACK.
- MAS220: Algebra. Tutorial demonstrator and marker. I have also written and coded online tests in AiM for this module.
- MAS114: Numbers and Groups. Tutorial demonstrator and marker.
- MAS241 tutorial demonstrator. This is a second year mathematics module for second year undergraduates in electrical engineering.
- Year 12 and Year 13 A-level enrichment classes and STEP classes.
- Dissertation Support for M.Sc. Statistics students.

### University of Leeds

- MATH1005: Core Mathematics. Tutorial demonstrator and marker.
- MATH1515: Interest Rates and Cashflow Modelling. Tutorial demonstrator and marker.
- I have been a mentor in a scheme designed to help PhD students who are new to teaching.





## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/DanGraves1/DanGraves1.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
